# hMPX-Analysis

The first script (hMPX_Reference_Mapping_and_Variant_Calling.sh) is involved in genomic analysis through sequence mapping, variant calling, and output formatting. It begins by downloading and converting a given set of sequence read archives to fastq format. Then, it uses bwa-mem2 to map these sequences to a reference genome and generate Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM) files. These SAM files are then converted to Binary Alignment/Map (BAM) files, sorted, and indexed for efficient downstream analysis. Finally, using bcftools, variants are called with respect to the reference genome and saved into a Binary Call Format (BCF) file, which is further converted into a human-readable Variant Call Format (VCF) file. Tools utilized in this script include prefetch, fastq-dump, bwa-mem2, samtools, and bcftools.

The second script (hMPX_Genome_Assembly_and_Quality_Assessment.sh) conducts a genome assembly and quality assessment process. It first downloads a sequence read archive and converts it into fastq format. The script then performs genome assembly using two different tools, Velvet and SPAdes. The quality of these assemblies is evaluated using the QUAST tool, which compares the assembly metrics. Additionally, the script keeps a record of the time and memory usage for each of these operations. Tools used in this script include prefetch, fastq-dump, Velvet, SPAdes, and QUAST.
